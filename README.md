Nandini CloudFolio is a personal portfolio website hosted on AWS EC2 and Amazon S3. This project showcases my skills in cloud computing, web development, and basic AWS infrastructure. The goal was to deploy a cost-effective, scalable, static portfolio using cloud-native tools. This was taught in my summer placement class. This project helped me to understand the fundamentals of cloud hosting by deploying a static portfolio website using AWS EC2 and Amazon S3. I gained hands-on experience in setting up cloud infrastructure, configuring security, and managing static web content. It strengthened my skills in cloud computing, frontend development, and practical deployment using real-world tools.
